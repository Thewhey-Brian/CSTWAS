Description: Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is introduced to identify 
    significant expression-trait associations through imputations. It has been widely 
    used to analyze tissue-specific associations with the reference expression 
    quantitative trait loci (eQTL) panel. To increase the statistical power of TWAS results, 
    meta-analysis methods aggregating TWAS results across multiple tissues are developed. 
    However, most existing meta-analysis methods lose interpretation of disease etiology and 
    have limited power to identify weaker associations when only a few tissues are weakly 
    activated. Therefore, we developed the cross-tissue subset-based meta-analysis method, CSTWAS. 
    In this package, we aggregate the TWAS results across tissues and perform meta-analysis 
    through the subset-based test. R functions are provided for researchers to integrate 
    TWAS results across multiple tissues and visualize the result.
